1. Change the input signal frequency at function generator every 4 or 5 seconds. The range is from 5hz to 17hz. In the mean time, record input/output signal using arduino_read.py
2. Use data_process.m to read the input/output signal and remove error data points if necessary.
3. Use Matlab system id toolbox to identify the system.
