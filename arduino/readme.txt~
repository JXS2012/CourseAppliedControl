extra-libs:
	install these lib to sketchbook first

pc-side: 
	Python code that read from arduino through serial port
	Log/plot input-voltage/output-speed
		ToDo: Convert the unit of output-speed to rad/sec
	System_id: an example that tries to id the motor

arduino-side: 
	1:read input-voltage through analog A3
	2:read encode counts through pin (2,3)
	3:send readings to pc at 100 hz sampling rate
